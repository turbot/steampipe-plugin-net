# Table: net_dns_reverse - Query DNS Reverse Zones using SQL

DNS service is a scalable, reliable, and managed Domain Name System (DNS) solution. It enables developers and businesses to route end users to internet applications by translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into numeric IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to connect to each other. A Reverse DNS (rDNS) is the determination of a domain name associated with an IP address via querying DNS.

## Table Usage Guide

The `net_dns_reverse` table provides insights into Reverse DNS Zones within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's DNS service. As a network administrator, explore reverse DNS lookup details through this table, including IP address mapping and associated metadata. Utilize it to uncover information about IP addresses, such as their associated domain names, aiding in network troubleshooting and security investigations.

**Important Notes**
- You must specify the `ip_address` column in the `where` clause to query this table.
