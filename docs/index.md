# Net + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is a CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

The net plugin is a set of utility tables for steampipe to query attributes of X.509 certificates associated with websites, DNS records, and connectivity to specific network socket addresses.

For example:

```sql
select
  issuer, 
  not_after as exp_date 
from 
  net_certificate
where
  domain = 'steampipe.io';
```

```sh
+----------------------------+---------------------+
| issuer                     | exp_date            |
+----------------------------+---------------------+
| CN=R3,O=Let's Encrypt,C=US | 2021-02-24 03:02:15 |
+----------------------------+---------------------+
```
